# Intrusion Detection Program

## Overview

This repository contains an Intrusion Detection system that monitors and detects potential security breaches in a network. It analyzes incoming traffic, identifies patterns that indicate malicious activity, and generates alerts for the network administrator.

## Features

- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious behavior.
- Signature-based Detection: Compares traffic patterns with known signatures of malicious activities.

- Anomaly-based Detection: Identifies unusual traffic behavior that may indicate an intrusion.
- Customizable Alerts: Sends alerts via email or logs them into the system when potential threats are detected.

- Scalable: Designed to work with various types of networks and traffic loads.
